226. Invert Binary Tree - Easy

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.
Invert means to create a mirror image of itself.


Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

Example 2:

Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,3,1]

Example 3:

Input: root = []
Output: []


Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100



/*  Time Complexity: 0(n)
----------------------
In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals are Depth-First traversals.

For a Graph, the complexity of a Depth First Traversal is O(n + m), where n is
the number of nodes, and m is the number of edges.

Since a Binary Tree is also a Graph, the same applies here. The complexity of
each of these Depth-first traversals is O(n+m).

Since the number of edges that can originate from a node is limited to 2 in the
case of a Binary Tree, the maximum number of total edges in a Binary Tree is
n-1, where n is the total number of nodes.

The complexity then becomes O(n + n-1), which is O(n).

Space Complexity: O(h)
----------------------
where h = tree height */
