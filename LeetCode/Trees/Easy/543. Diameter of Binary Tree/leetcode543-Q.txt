NOTE: The definition of the diameter of a binary tree as defined by this problem
is incorrect. The correct definition for the diameter of a binary tree is
defined as the number of NODES on the longest path between two end nodes and
not the number of EDGES as in the case of this problem.

543. Diameter of Binary Tree - Easy

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two
nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges
between them.


Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1


Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100


Intuitive Understanding:
------------------------

The diameter of a tree T is the largest of the following quantities:

* the diameter of T’s left subtree.
* the diameter of T’s right subtree.
* the longest path between leaves that goes through the root of T, which can be
	computed from the heights of the subtrees of T.
