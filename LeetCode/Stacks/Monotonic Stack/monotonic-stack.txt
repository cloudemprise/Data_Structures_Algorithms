What is a Monotonic Stack?

A monotonic stack is a stack whose elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing. It contains all qualities that a typical stack has and its elements are all monotonic decreasing or increasing.

Below are the features of a monotonic stack:

    It is a range of queries in an array situation
    The minima/maxima elements
    When an element is popped from the monotonic stack, it will never be utilised again.

The monotonic stack problem is mainly the previous/next smaller/larger problem. It maintains monotonicity while popping elements when a new item is pushed into the stack.

How to achieve Monotonic Increasing Stack?

To create a Monotonic Increasing Stack, start with an empty stack, then, while iterating through elements in a sequence, keep removing elements from the stack as long as they are smaller than the current element, and push the current element onto the stack. This process ensures the stack maintains a strictly increasing order from bottom to top.
